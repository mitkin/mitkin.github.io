Book: First steps towards CI
============================

Browsing twitter I stubmbled upon an interesting book_:

    Reliable and Fast Deployments Through Automation
    Your first steps towards Continuous Delivery

The book is an introduction into the principles of continious integration (CI) practices, gives a summary of what are the benefits and pitfalls of CI.
It starts with the basic approaches like ```git pull``` and finishes with the deploying Ansible playbooks in the network sandbox managed by Vagrant.

I feel that the material is aimed at the public that is looking for where to start with the CI. The more advanced audience might find some of the chapters helpful (I personally always struggle to remember how to build Debian packages).
