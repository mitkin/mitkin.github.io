            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Book: First steps towards CI</h1>
<p>Browsing twitter I stubmbled upon an interesting <a class="reference external" href="https://leanpub.com/deploy">book</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Reliable and Fast Deployments Through Automation
Your first steps towards Continuous Delivery</div></blockquote>
<p>The book is an introduction into the principles of continious integration (CI) practices, gives a summary of what are the benefits and pitfalls of CI.
It starts with the basic approaches like <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`git</span> <span class="pre">pull`</span></span> and finishes with the deploying Ansible playbooks in the network sandbox managed by Vagrant.</p>
<p>I feel that the material is aimed at the public that is looking for where to start with the CI. The more advanced audience might find some of the chapters helpful (I personally always struggle to remember how to build Debian packages).</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Bayesian Methods for Hackers</h1>
<blockquote>
<div>You are a skilled programmer, but bugs still slip into your code. After a particularly difficult implementation of an algorithm, you decide to test your code on a trivial example. It passes. You test the code on a harder problem. It passes once again. And it passes the next, even more difficult, test too! You are starting to believe that there may be no bugs in this code...
If you think this way, then congratulations, you already are thinking Bayesian! Bayesian inference is simply updating your beliefs after considering new evidence. A Bayesian can rarely be certain about a result, but he or she can be very confident. Just like in the example above, we can never be 100% sure that our code is bug-free unless we test it on every possible problem; something rarely possible in practice. Instead, we can test it on a large number of problems, and if it succeeds we can feel more confident about our code, but still not certain. Bayesian inference works identically: we update our beliefs about an outcome; rarely can we be absolutely sure unless we rule out all other alternatives.</div></blockquote>
<p>If you are into Bayesian statistics and applying those principled to the code you develop, this <a class="reference external" href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Chapter1_Introduction/Chapter1.ipynb">book</a> is a must read. Seriously good introduction into Bayesian statistics with application to computational problems and <a class="reference external" href="https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc">PyMC</a>, a python Bayesian statistics module.</p>
